# Drawing-App
## Description

A Drawing app with the following features:
1. Draw with various tools.
2. Change the line width of each tool.
3. Change colour of tool.
4. Undo the last drawing.

## How to Use
The starting tool has been defaulted to 'Pen', to switch to a different tool simply click on the corresponding button.

Shapes are placed by holding left click, moving the mouse upwards or downwards will increase or decrease the size of the shape, this does not apply to 'Line' and 'Pen' tools.

The line width and colour of a shape cannot be changed after placement.

Pressing Undo will remove the last placed drawing.

## What I've learnt

This project allowed me to become acquainted with canvas and appreciate it's use case.

Because of the nature of canvas in relation to the viewport I gained a better understanding of Javascript methods that allow me to have accurate pixel positioning.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this project was that a stroke in a canvas has it's own set of properties which can be stored within an array and can be removed by simply popping it off the array.
